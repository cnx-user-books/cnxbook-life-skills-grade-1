      <para id="id13584799">Learners should get the opportunity to express their feelings about going to school. Some of them might be familiar with a school environment, and others not.</para>
      <list id="id9805174" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>Discuss their different emotions and help them to identify these.</item>
        <item>Repeat the discussion after two weeks. This will enable you to determine whether they feel secure and more at ease. Ask questions like “why?”. How does it enable them to cope with an unfamiliar situation? Are they aware of other similar situations?</item>
      </list>
      <para id="id6641505">To some learners, school may be a whole new experience. Others may be more familiar to the school environment, because of pre-school. Whatever the case may be, learners must get used to and manage the changed environment of class and school. They should, for example, take part in class activities, should be able to sit still for a given time and await their turn.</para>
      <para id="id7618851">Divide the class into groups of +/- five learners. Each group must think of three important things they can do in class each day to help keep the classroom clean and tidy. With the help of the class, the teacher now writes down the five most important class duties. The learners must take turns to fulfil these duties. (The teacher can draw up a duty list.) Have a class discussion about other people who have tasks and responsibilities at school (for example, the cleaners, the headmaster, the teachers or the prefects.) What will happen if they don’t fulfil these duties? Emphasise the responsibility that each child has in class too, for example, clean up where they have worked (EMS 2.1).</para>
      <para id="id4237346">The learners must design their own photo-frame. This can be used on their table in class or at home. Revise the technological process that was explained in module 1. Discuss the different materials they can use. The learners must design, make and evaluate the organiser. (Tech 1.1 - 1.4).</para>
